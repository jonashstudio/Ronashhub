update v2
2.0.0.3
1. Loader (Part 1)

Clean, animated progress bar.

Text label “RONASH v2 Loading…”.

Auto-close after loading finishes.



2. UI Window Structure

Placeholder Window table to simulate a tabbed UI system.

Supports multiple tabs and sections (clean structure for expansion).

Notifications system integrated (Window:Notify).



3. Part 2 – Fly

A placeholder for your fixed fly logic.

You can plug your existing fly code here so it works with the new tab structure.

Supports speed control, up/down buttons, and toggle on/off.



4. Part 3 – Tab-by-Tab Features

Valex Tab: Auto Farm, Auto Collect toggles.

Ronin Tab: Kill Aura, Auto Stab toggles.

Settings Tab: Show/Hide UI toggle and Theme dropdown.

Discord Tab: Button to copy your Discord link.



5. Tab-by-Tab Structure

Each major feature set is separated into tabs.

You can expand by just adding sections and buttons inside each tab.



6. Notifications

When a toggle or button is clicked, it pops up a notification (like “Auto Farm Enabled” or “Discord link copied”).




✅ Key differences from your previous parts:

Now all parts are structured in one file, easy to maintain.

Fly is isolated and can be integrated without conflicting with other features.

Tabs make it organized: Valex, Ronin, Settings, Discord.

Loader is functional and closes automatically
